# Movie-Review-Classification
Project Overview
This project aims to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative using a machine learning model. By analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews, this project helps in automatically understanding the opinion expressed in a review without human intervention. Sentiment analysis, in this case, involves text classification where the goal is to classify each review as belonging to one of two classes: positive or negative.

We will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and apply various machine learning models to accurately classify the sentiment of the reviews.

Workflow
Data Collection and Understanding

The dataset used contains a collection of movie reviews, with each review labeled as either positive or negative.
The dataset typically contains two columns:
Review: The text of the movie review.
Sentiment: The label indicating whether the review is positive (1) or negative (0).
Data Preprocessing

Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, numbers, and other irrelevant information.
Tokenization: Split the reviews into individual words (tokens) for easier analysis.
Stop Words Removal: Remove common words like "and," "the," and "is" that do not contribute to the sentiment.
Lemmatization/Stemming: Convert words to their base or root form to reduce dimensionality (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
Vectorization: Convert the text data into numerical features using methods such as:
Bag of Words (BoW)
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Word Embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform a basic analysis of the distribution of reviews, length of reviews, and common words used in positive vs. negative reviews.
Visualize the dataset using word clouds, histograms, and bar charts to understand the nature of the reviews.
Feature Selection

Select relevant features from the text data that are most likely to help in classifying the sentiment of the reviews. This may involve:
Frequency of words or n-grams.
Statistical analysis to identify key differentiators between positive and negative reviews.
Model Selection

Test several machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification, such as:
Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model that performs well on text data.
Naive Bayes: Often used for text classification tasks due to its efficiency and performance on small datasets.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Known for high performance in binary classification problems.
Deep Learning (Optional): You can explore models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or BERT for a more sophisticated solution using neural networks.
Model Training

Train the model(s) using the preprocessed and vectorized text data.
Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using a separate test dataset.
Metrics for evaluation include:
Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision and Recall: To understand the balance between false positives and false negatives.
F1-score: A combined metric that accounts for both precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize the model’s performance and understand where it is making mistakes.
Model Optimization

Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., using GridSearchCV).
Try techniques such as feature scaling or different vectorization methods to improve the model’s performance.
Deployment (Optional)

Once the model is ready, package it into a deployable format.
Create a web application or API where users can input a movie review and get a predicted sentiment as output.
Deployment options can include Flask/Django for web apps or integration with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP) for scalability.
